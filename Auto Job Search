Agent context needed: Web search, user profile, default resume list (some resumes catered to general fields e.g. App dev, business analytics, AI/ML engineering, etc.), list of user projects/certificates

Agent with access to web search pulls curated list of job positions user is qualified for
Parses through job listings on: LinkedIn, Indeed, GitHub (Subject to change/whatever we find works best)
Creates list of high value & low value positions/positions
User then confirms if position is high/low value
If high value, agent updates closes matching default resume to meet job description
If low value, agent uploads closes matching default resume
Agentic integration: automatically fills out user data based on provided context to job applications
